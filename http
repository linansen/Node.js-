           'content-length': '123',
           'content-type': 'text/plain',
           'connection': 'keep-alive',
           'host': 'mysite.com',
           'accept': '*/*' 
         }

         but it does not parse the actual headers or the body.
         
         The raw headers as they were received are retained in the rawHeaders property, which is an array of [key, value, key2, value2, ...].
